"""Hermes Agent registration for the `notes` skills plugin.

Registers the five documentation skills with Hermes' native skill loader so
`skill_view("notes:<name>")` can load them on demand.

Like the sibling `harness` plugin, this one injects no session bootstrap
context: the notes skills are task-triggered (you reach for one when a piece of
work is finished and needs writing up), so there is nothing worth paying for on
every first turn.
